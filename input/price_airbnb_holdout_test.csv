I would say because of my experience traveling using Airbnb rest assured your stay will be very pleasant.I really take pride how clean I keep my place there is a cleaning crew of 3 that cleans entire house after every check out using Lysol making sure no germ is on site. I honestly believe no hotel can maintain what we do here. I’m always available between 8am to 8pm even later then that just shoot me a text if there is a problem I’ll be glad to help. I believe honesty between host and guest is the key to having a great experience.  I also rent out my Vehicles thru a sharing app similar to Airbnb let me know if you need one during you stay. Lastly I am a season ticket holder for the Boston Celtic great floors seats if you happen to stay while there is a game be sure to reach out.

We do use more Clorox for surface sanitization than normal cleaning, which unfortunately does comes with the smell of Hydrogen peroxide. And our unit does not have an HVAC system but in-wall AC.   

Here at Nora’s house, We run all our unit like hotel, with 24 hours on site assistant and all white linen and towel. My main task at the Nora house team is communication and concierge during day time.  

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard.

The Callahan Tunnel, to be more specific. Encompassing so much more than Logan International Airport, Eastie is undergoing a real estate renaissance. In the last few years, the neighborhood has become so popular with young professionals due to its (relatively) reasonable prices and proximity to downtown. The result is a place where you can buy $1 pupusas within steps of a million-dollar condo on the water.<br /><br />East Boston is chock full of historical landmarks, from the Madonna Queen of the Universe Shrine in Orient Heights to the Temple Ohabei Shalom Cemetery, the first Jewish cemetery in the state. It’s also home to the ICA Watershed, as well as one of the most beautiful neighborhood branches of Boston Public Library, which overlooks the Bremen Street Park.<br /><br />And did we mention the food?

Those visiting Boston often begin by taking an Old-Town Trolley Tour. This hop-on-hop-off bus tour travels throughout our storied city, offering guests the opportunity to stop in Beacon Hill, Fenway Park, Harvard University, along the Seaport or elsewhere in our city. It’s a great way to take in the scope of our city, while exploring as much as you wish. Boston transportation is visitor-friendly. Buses, water ferries and the subway, known as the T, make it easy, quick and affordable to visit various parts of the city. Buses and the subway are steps from the front door of the Boston Park Plaza.

We are a Boston icon that is as much a part of the city’s heritage as the Boston Tea Party and the annual Head of the Charles Regatta. We offer an experience that is truly one-of-a-kind, a place where you can enjoy a richly textured and profoundly memorable taste of the real Boston.

Following a landmark renovation, our hotel, Boston Park Plaza offers guests all the charisma and deeply individual charm of a historic hotel with the effortless comforts of a new one. Once again a destination unto itself, our hotel offers incomparable proximity to everything that makes Boston a treasured destination. We are one of the most sought-after hotels near Boston Common and enjoy an ideal location among the hotels in downtown Boston, just steps away from the Public Garden, Theater District and many of the city’s most popular historical sites.

When you’re looking for the best hotel, Boston Park Plaza provides an unrivaled legacy of service. When Boston Park Plaza opened in 1927, it redefined a standard of hospitality that guests came to expect. With our history of innovation and continued dedication to our guests, we are proud to be recognized as Boston’s Most Beloved.

We do use more Clorox for surface sanitization than normal cleaning, which unfortunately does comes with the smell of Hydrogen peroxide. And our unit does not have an HVAC system but in-wall AC.   

Here at Nora’s house, We run all our unit like hotel, with 24 hours on site assistant and all white linen and towel. My main task at the Nora house team is communication and concierge during day time.  

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard. 

We set our automated pricing tool to be at least 20% lower than other similar Airbnb's in the area, and at least 40% lower than surrounding hotels. Please be considerate when using AC and leave the apartment in a manageable condition to help us keep the cost low.

I started on Airbnb with ""Gorgeous Cape Cod"" property in May 2015, listed our renovated ""Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated ""Beautiful Boston Brownstone"" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - ""Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 170 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

We're Eddie and Nayeli! A young and fun loving couple - currently living and working in this great city of Boston.  

Now, we are both from Texas, but we met and got married in Shanghai just before repatriating back to the U.S. It’s a very long story!  We both love to eat, drink, host, mingle - and travel.  We are always thinking, planning and/or dreaming of new adventures close and afar.  Anywhere we travel, we usually seek out the latest culinary experience, or are in search mode for that perfect cocktail anywhere we go.

And right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We believe that hospitality is really an acquired art form for making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  We believe that it is the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always!
 
We have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand -  spent time in Europe before moving to Beijing  in 2000, right after graduating from college.

Our paths crossed in China in 2010 - and in 2015 we tied the knot in Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we repatriate back to the US - and now call Boston home.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US - and even more so when we have the opportunity to live in this great city.

Look forward to hosting you soon!

My name is Cindy, part of the Nora House team of 6 friends. I'm traveling globetrotter, real estate professional, homeowner, mother of two, and also a neat freak. 

We Are Fully Aware of the Covid-19 in the Boston area, and we have completely enhanced our cleaning and sanitization process after each guest. We do use more Clorox for surface sanitization than normal cleaning, which unfortunately does comes with the smell of Hydrogen peroxide. And our unit does not have an HVAC system but in-wall AC.   

Here at Nora’s house, We run all our unit like hotel, with 24 hours on site assistant and all white linen and towel. My main task at the Nora house team is communication and concierge during day time.  

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard. 

We set our automated pricing tool to be at least 20% lower than other similar Airbnb's in the area, and at least 40% lower than surrounding hotels. Please be considerate when using AC and leave the apartment in a manageable condition to help us keep the cost low.

My name is Cindy, part of the Nora House team of 6 friends. I'm traveling globetrotter, real estate professional, homeowner, mother of two, and also a neat freak. 

We Are Fully Aware of the Covid-19 in the Boston area, and we have completely enhanced our cleaning and sanitization process after each guest. We do use more Clorox for surface sanitization than normal cleaning, which unfortunately does comes with the smell of Hydrogen peroxide. And our unit does not have an HVAC system but in-wall AC.   

Here at Nora’s house, We run all our unit like hotel, with 24 hours on site assistant and all white linen and towel. My main task at the Nora house team is communication and concierge during day time.  

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard. 

We set our automated pricing tool to be at least 20% lower than other similar Airbnb's in the area, and at least 40% lower than surrounding hotels.

We're Eddie and Nayeli! A young and fun loving couple - currently living and working in this great city of Boston.  

Now, we are both from Texas, but we met and got married in Shanghai just before repatriating back to the U.S. It’s a very long story!  We both love to eat, drink, host, mingle - and travel.  We are always thinking, planning and/or dreaming of new adventures close and afar.  Anywhere we travel, we usually seek out the latest culinary experience, or are in search mode for that perfect cocktail anywhere we go.

And right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We believe that hospitality is really an acquired art form for making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  We believe that it is the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always!
 
We have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand -  spent time in Europe before moving to Beijing  in 2000, right after graduating from college.

Our paths crossed in China in 2010 - and in 2015 we tied the knot in Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we repatriate back to the US - and now call Boston home.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US - and even more so when we have the opportunity to live in this great city.

Look forward to hosting you soon!
